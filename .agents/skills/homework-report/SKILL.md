description: Use after grade-homework to produce a teacher-facing Typst PDF report that shows each student's submission images side-by-side with their per-question marks, feedback, and flags. Triggers on phrases like "generate the grading report", "build a report from the marks", "make a PDF with the marked homework".

# homework-report

## When to use

- After `grade-homework` has written `grades/grades.csv` and `grades/feedback/*.md`.
- User wants a single shareable PDF (for review, return to students, or archive) that shows the original submission next to the grading decisions.

Do NOT use for:

- Grading itself (use `grade-homework`).
- Individual student feedback only (the markdown in `grades/feedback/<student>.md` is already that).

## What this skill produces

- `report/images/<student>-N.jpg` — one image per submission page, converted / copied from the student's original files.
- `report/grading_report.typ` — the Typst source, overwritable and hand-editable.
- `report/grading_report.pdf` — compiled report, one page per student.

## Prerequisites (hard gate)

Probe before running. If a required tool is missing, **stop and ask the user
for permission to install** via the platform-appropriate command below.

Required:

| Tool       | Probe              | Purpose                       |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `typst`    | `typst --version`  | Compiles the report           |
| `pdftoppm` | `pdftoppm -v`      | Renders PDF submissions → JPG |

Conditional (only if any submission is `.docx` — check the working dir first):

| Path       | Tools                                                  | Notes                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Preferred  | `libreoffice` (or `soffice`)                           | Single tool, best fidelity  |
| Fallback   | `pandoc` + `google-chrome` / `chromium` (± `inkscape`) | `inkscape` only for WMF/EMF |

Skip this conditional probe entirely if there are no `.docx` files in the
working directory.

### Probe + install flow

```bash
# Required
need=()
for cmd in typst pdftoppm; do
  command -v "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1 || need+=("$cmd")
done

# Conditional: only if .docx present
if ls "$PWD"/*.docx >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if ! command -v libreoffice >/dev/null 2>&1 && ! command -v soffice >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    if ! { command -v pandoc >/dev/null 2>&1 \
        && { command -v google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 \
          || command -v chromium     >/dev/null 2>&1; }; }; then
      need+=("docx-toolchain")  # see install table
    fi
  fi
fi
[ ${#need[@]} -gt 0 ] && echo "MISSING: ${need[*]}" || echo "OK"
```

If anything is missing, figure out the right install command for the user's
environment at runtime (inspect `uname -s` and which of `brew`/`apt`/`dnf`/
`pacman`/`winget`/etc. is available — see `bootstrap` Step 0 for the
detection pattern) and propose the commands via `AskUserQuestion` before
running them. Tool-to-package notes you'll need:

- `pdftoppm` lives in the `poppler` / `poppler-utils` package across most
  package managers.
- `libreoffice` may be `libreoffice-fresh` on Arch and `--cask libreoffice`
  on Homebrew; on Windows use `TheDocumentFoundation.LibreOffice` via winget.
- Headless browser for the fallback path: `google-chrome` or `chromium` —
  either one works.
- `typst` isn't yet in `apt`/`dnf` — fall back to the official prebuilt
  binary (https://github.com/typst/typst/releases) when needed.
- `inkscape` (only needed if a `.docx` embeds WMF/EMF that the fallback path
  must convert) is truly optional — `to_images.py` flags `needs_manual_review`
  and continues if it's missing.

After installation, re-probe with the script above. Do not proceed until the
required set is satisfied; if the user declines, abort the skill with a clear
message.

## Workflow

Skill root: `~/.Codex/skills/homework-report/`.

### Step 1 — Run the builder

```bash
python ~/.Codex/skills/homework-report/scripts/build_report.py "$PWD"
```

The script:

1. Reads `grades/grades.csv` and each `grades/feedback/<student>.md`.
2. Recursively discovers each student's submission files under `$PWD` (reusing `grade-homework`'s `discover.py`).
3. For each student, converts submission files to page images via `grade-homework`'s `to_images.py`, and copies them into `report/images/`.
4. Emits `report/grading_report.typ` with a per-student spread: submission images on the left, score table + feedback markdown + flags on the right.
5. Compiles `grading_report.pdf` if `typst` is on PATH; otherwise leaves the `.typ` file and prints the compile command.

### Step 2 — Inspect and hand off

Open `report/grading_report.pdf`, spot-check a few students' rendering (especially any with rotated phone photos or DOCX originals), and send to the teacher.

If the rendering is off for a particular student (images rotated wrong, pages missing), delete their entry from `report/images/` and re-run — the script is idempotent.

## Flags / failure modes

- **`grades/grades.csv` missing** → stop and tell the user to run `grade-homework` first.
- **Feedback file missing for a student in the CSV** → include the student with scores only; note in output that feedback was missing.
- **DOCX submission and no conversion toolchain** → that student's section shows a placeholder instead of images; the score table and feedback still render.
- **`typst` not installed** → script writes the `.typ` source and exits cleanly with instructions.

## Customization

The Typst template is inlined in `build_report.py` (function `render_typst`). Edit that function to change layout, colors, per-part weights display, or to add a class-level score histogram. The template uses only the Typst standard library — no external packages — so compilation is offline.
